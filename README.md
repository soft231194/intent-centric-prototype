# Intent-Centric Frontend Prototype

## Overview

This app demonstrates **intent-centric architecture** for multi-chain applications.

- **Users express their intent** (e.g., swap assets, send tokens).
- The system simulates how a backend could **route and fulfill intents** across multiple blockchains, abstracting away complexity.

## How does this help the multi-chain ecosystem?

- **Simplifies User Experience:** No need to know technical details about bridging, protocols, or chains.
- **Optimizes Routing:** Intents can be fulfilled through the best available path, increasing efficiency and interoperability.
- **Scalable:** As new chains/protocols are added, the intent engine adapts without extra UI/UX work.

## Running Locally
